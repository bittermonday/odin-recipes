        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.</p>

            <p>Dredge cod in batter, one piece at a time, and place in hot oil. Fry fish in batches until golden brown on all sides; drain on paper towels. Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as needed to maintain 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
